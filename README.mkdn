# NAME

Git::ReleaseRepo - Manage a release repository of Git submodules

# VERSION

version 0.002

# DESCRIPTION

This application manages a Git repository for releases. It also follows the
"Semantic Versioning" specification.

# SUBMODULES

# BRANCHES AND TAGS

Branches are for major and minor releases. Tags are for bugfix releases.

    v1.0 - Branch for the 1.0 release cycle
    v1.0.0 - Tag for the first release in the 1.0 release cycle
    v1.0.1 - Tag for a bugfix release
    v1.1 - Branch for the 1.1 release cycle
    v1.1.0 - Tag for the first release in the 1.1 release cycle

The tip of the release branch will always be the latest code for that release,
even if it is not yet part of a bugfix release.

Branches will only ever be m/^${PREFIX}\\d+\[.\]\\d+/.

# SEMANTIC VERSIONING

## MAJOR/MINOR VERSIONS

New major and minor versions are created from HEAD. When a new major/minor release
is created, a new branch is created to allow for bugfix versions.

The same branches are created in submodules to allow for bugfix commits.

## BUGFIX VERSIONS

New bugfix versions are created from the release branch.
